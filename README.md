DEPLOYMENT UPDATE 10 Jan 2025 22:42:

Not deployed anywhere, yet/ANYMORE - due to saving on Cloud costs for Python-app web hosting with PostgreSQL.  
Heroku is too expensive for a pet project (Â£14 a month!! - Heroku app is awesome, but who can afford it for a pet project - so, no thank you), PythonAnywhere doesn't offer a FREE Postgres DB and there does not seem to be an option to connect a Free Neon PostgreSQL to my Free account or I do not know how to - yet\
Nevertheless, the sooner I find a FREE solution or Change a DB or learn more about connecting the Neon DB in PythonAnywhere - the faster the app will be web-deployed.
